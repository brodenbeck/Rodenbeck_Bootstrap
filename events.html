			<h1>Events by Entertainment 720</h1>
			<p>As Pawnee's first and only high-end, all-media, entertainment conglomerate, we are committed to bringing you the greatest, flashiest, classiest, dopest events as a one-stop shop for all of your entertainment needs. What do we do? Well, it's too hard to explain, so come see for yourself.</p>
			<br/><br/><p class="red-text">We regret to inform the citizens of Pawnee and loyal patrons of e720 that Entertainment 720 has been forced to declare bankruptcy after just a short few months. Read our letter <a href="about.html#letter">here</a>.</p>

				<p>It was a display that rivaled that of the Superbowl halftime show on a budget for a toddler's birthday party. This great miniature horse deserved no less. This event was the first event with Entertainment 720's name and committment attached to it, and as such, it was one of the greatest spectacles to behold. Ceremonial wreaths were laid, torches lit, and dreams fulfilled. This event would be remembered as the one to launch Leslie Knope's political career. Li'l Sebastian would have been proud. RIP you glorious horse.</p>

		<h2>Joan Calamezzo Book Club</h2><br/>

			<div class="col-sm-3 col-sm-offset-1">
				<p>Although not a spectacle, event, or party, Entertainment 720 was hired to help Governor Knope (before her governorship, when she was merely running for City Council) secure the coveted Joan Calamezzo book club sticker for her book about Pawnee, Indiana. We're going to be honest: we didn't read it because it looked boring. However, we did the job anyway. The sticker was eventually not secured through no fault of our own. It turns out Leslie is a filthy Eagletonian.</p>

		<p>Again, satisfied customer Leslie Knope hired Entertainment 720 to host a meet and greet with local business owners to help bolster her polling numbers with entrepreneurs and moguls in the area, most notably Martin Kernston of Kernston's Rubber Nipples. There was a limousine hot tub, dancers, and a cake with Entertainment 720's logo on top. When we do a business luncheon, we do it in style.</p>

		<p>To celebrate our tenure as business owners, we decided to throw one last AHmazing spectacle, a party to rival all other parties: the perfect event. With nonstop action for almost ten hours, every single attendee left having experienced the greatest party of all time. Special thanks to DJ Bluntz and NBA Pacers superstar Roy Hibbert for dishing out the beats and the shrimp.</p>
